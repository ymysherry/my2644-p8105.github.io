# This page contains information about me

As a second year student at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, I will be graduating in May, 2021 with a Master of Public Health in Biostatistics and a focus on Comparative Effectiveness and Outcome Research (CEOR). My practicum and previous internship experience at Daiichi Sankyo, Pfizer and Astra Zeneca deepened my interest in a career in the healthcare industry.
